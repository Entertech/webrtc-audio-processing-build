# ExportAudio SwiftPM Artifacts

`ExportAudio.xcframework` is generated by the GitHub Actions workflow
`agc2_prerelease.yml` and committed to this directory as part of the release PR.

This xcframework is referenced by `Package.swift` using a local path dependency,
which allows Xcode to properly embed the framework (avoiding the SPM URL dependency
limitation where dynamic libraries cannot be embedded).
